    <h2>AI Combat Manikin</h2>
    <p class="date">April 23, 2025</p>
    <p>
      Over the past 8 months, my team embarked on a journey to create an <b>interactive manikin for combat training</b>. The idea was sparked by the realization that traditional training dummies simply can’t replicate the unpredictability and responsiveness of a real opponent. We wanted to bridge that gap by building a manikin that could not only <b>react to trainee movements</b> but also <b>challenge them in dynamic, high-pressure scenarios.</b> The full overview of the project can be viewed <a href="https://capstoneshowcase.sutd.edu.sg/project/proj-s14-devt-ai-combat-training/" style="color: #6A0DAD; text-decoration: underline;">here</a>.

      <p style="text-indent: 0px;">
        As a member of the software team, my primary focus was:  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>System architecture & integration</b>: Designed a modular pipeline integrating a PyQt frontend GUI with a Python backend stack.</li>
        <li><b>Baton tracking</b>: Trained a FasterRCNN model to detect and track the baton’s path, ensuring the manikin could dodge or counter in real time.</li>
        <li><b>Graphical User Interface</b>: Developed a no-code PyQt interface with drag-and-drop scenario configuration and real-time feedback panels.</li>
        <li><b>Inference Optimization</b>: Implemented multithreading to parallelize inference pipelines from the two cameras, reducing end-to-end latency to < 50ms.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The <b>most rewarding moment came when the manikin flawlessly dodged attacks in real-time</b>—a testament to our tightly integrated system of Kalman filters, pose estimation, and decision algorithms. Seeing trainers effortlessly adjust dodge probability (10-90%) and combat modes via the GUI’s intuitive sliders and presets validated months spent refining both technical robustness and user experience, <b>proving that complex AI can coexist with simplicity</b>.

      <blockquote>
        Building this project deepened my expertise in <b>end-to-end system architecture</b>, <b>code optimization</b>, and <b>real-time data processing</b>. It also strengthened my skills in cross-team collaboration, rapid prototyping, and translating user requirements into intuitive interfaces and robust backend solutions.
